<!-- My research interests revolve around Model Driven Engineering, Model Transformation, and Data Engineering. 
I have been working with engineers at Stellantis Automotive company to address their systems engineering environment needs. 
In this context, I have been focused on designing, developing efficient transformation tools to bridge the modeling gap between automotive system architecture and software designs. 
Lately, I have been collaborating on research and development of AI applications for 

In my prior industrial role, I served as a Data Engineer at CubiCasa, where I led the development of essential tools for video frame annotation crucial for building information modeling (BIM). 
Additionally, I successfully created APIs and web services, establishing benchmarks to evaluate the performance of various machine learning models.

During my tenure as an Automation Engineer at GE Healthcare, I specialized in assessing and improving the performance of hospital bedside monitors. 
My daily responsibilities included designing and developing test suites, automating test execution, analyzing Failure Mode scenarios, and actively contributing to the software development process. -->
